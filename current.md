# Current Development Progress

## Summary

As of today, we have completed the following steps in the `rust_market` project:

1. **Initialized the Rust Project**

   - Set up a new Rust project using `cargo init`.
   - Configured the `Cargo.toml` with necessary dependencies, including `actix-web`, `diesel`, and others.

2. **Set Up the Database**

   - Installed PostgreSQL and created the `rust_market` database.
   - Used Diesel CLI to set up migrations for the database schema.

3. **Created Database Migrations**

   - Developed migrations to create tables for `users`, `products`, `orders`, and `order_items`.
   - Ensured foreign key relationships and indexing for performance.

4. **Implemented Models**

   - Created Rust structs in `src/models/mod.rs` corresponding to the database tables.
   - Derived necessary traits like `Queryable`, `Insertable`, `Serialize`, and `Deserialize`.

5. **Established Database Connection Pool**

   - Implemented `src/db.rs` to manage the database connection pool using `r2d2`.
   - Ensured secure error handling and environment variable management.

6. **Set Up the Actix-Web Server**

   - Configured `src/main.rs` to initialize the web server.
   - Added middleware for logging and prepared the application for routing.

7. **Formatted and Linted the Code**

   - Ran `cargo fmt` for code formatting.
   - Used `cargo clippy` to detect and fix potential issues.

8. **Successfully Built the Project**

   - Ran `cargo build`, and the project compiled successfully.
   - Verified that all configurations and dependencies are correctly set up.

## Next Steps

To continue the development workflow, here are the planned tasks:

1. **Implement API Endpoints**

   - **User Authentication**

     - **Register New Users**: `POST /api/register`
       - Implement user registration with input validation.
       - Hash passwords securely before storing them in the database.
       - Use `Option` and `Result` types for robust error handling.
       - Avoid using `unwrap()`; prefer `expect("Meaningful error message")`.

     - **User Login**: `POST /api/login`
       - Authenticate users and generate JWT tokens for session management.
       - Ensure sensitive data is handled securely.
       - Provide clear error messages without exposing internal details.

     - **Secure Endpoints**
       - Protect routes using middleware that verifies JWT tokens.
       - Implement role-based access control for admin and user functionalities.

   - **Product Management**

     - **List Products**: `GET /api/products`
       - Retrieve a list of products with pagination support.
       - Cache frequent queries using Redis to improve performance.

     - **Create Product (Admin)**: `POST /api/products`
       - Allow admins to add new products with detailed validation.
       - Ensure data integrity and proper error handling.

     - **Update Product (Admin)**: `PUT /api/products/{id}`
       - Implement updates with optimistic locking to prevent race conditions.
       - Validate input data and handle potential errors gracefully.

     - **Delete Product (Admin)**: `DELETE /api/products/{id}`
       - Soft-delete products to maintain historical data.
       - Confirm actions to prevent accidental deletions.

   - **Order Processing**

     - **Create Order**: `POST /api/orders`
       - Validate stock availability before confirming orders.
       - Implement transactional operations to maintain consistency.
       - Provide real-time feedback to the user on order status.

     - **Get User Orders**: `GET /api/orders`
       - Retrieve a list of orders specific to the authenticated user.
       - Ensure data is delivered securely and efficiently.

     - **Get Order Details**: `GET /api/orders/{id}`
       - Provide detailed information about a specific order.
       - Verify that the requesting user has permission to access the order.

2. **Set Up WebSocket Communication**

   - Implement the WebSocket server using `tokio-tungstenite` to handle real-time stock updates.
   - **Integrate with Redis** for pub/sub to broadcast stock changes.
   - Use `tokio` for asynchronous operations to manage concurrency effectively.
   - Ensure that structs used in WebSocket communications derive `Serialize` and `Deserialize`.

3. **Integrate Redis Cache**

   - Use Redis for caching frequently accessed data such as product listings.
   - Implement functions to update and retrieve data from Redis with proper error handling.
   - Limit cache size and implement expiration policies to manage memory usage.

4. **Improve Error Handling**

   - Use custom error types with the `thiserror` crate to provide detailed error information.
   - Handle errors at each layer of the application to prevent panics and crashes.
   - Log errors appropriately using the `log` crate, without exposing sensitive information.

5. **Add Input Validation**

   - Validate all incoming data using crates like `validator` or `serde_valid`.
   - Implement validation annotations on data models to ensure consistency.
   - Return informative error messages to the client when validation fails.

6. **Implement Logging and Monitoring**

   - Enhance logging using `env_logger` or similar crates to capture detailed runtime information.
   - Set up monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for performance tracking.
   - Use structured logging to facilitate analysis and debugging.

7. **Write Tests**

   - **Unit Tests**
     - Write tests for individual functions and modules.
     - Use mocking where necessary to isolate components.

   - **Integration Tests**
     - Test API endpoints using `actix-web`'s testing utilities.
     - Simulate database interactions with a test database instance.

   - **Performance Tests**
     - Assess the application's performance under load.
     - Identify and address bottlenecks in the system.

8. **Update Documentation**

   - Keep `documentation/core.md` up to date with new changes and architectural decisions.
   - Add any new diagrams or update existing ones in `documentation/diagrams/`.
   - Document API endpoints using tools like OpenAPI/Swagger for clarity.

9. **Implement AI-Based Features**

   - **Personalized Recommendations**
     - Integrate AI APIs to provide product recommendations based on user behavior.
     - Handle external API calls using `reqwest`, ensuring robust error handling and retries.
     - Parse JSON responses carefully to prevent runtime errors and ensure data integrity.

   - **Chatbot Integration**
     - Incorporate a chatbot for customer support using AI APIs.
     - Implement rate limiting to manage API usage and adhere to provider policies.

   - **Strong Error Handling**
     - Validate and sanitize all AI-generated content before displaying it to users.
     - Log API interactions for monitoring and debugging purposes.

10. **Security Enhancements**

    - **Input Sanitization**
      - Prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other common vulnerabilities.
      - Use parameterized queries with Diesel to safeguard database interactions.

    - **Authentication Security**
      - Implement two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced account security.
      - Use secure cookies and ensure proper session management.

    - **Cargo Clippy and Auditing**

      - Use `cargo audit` to detect vulnerable dependencies.

    - **Secure WebSockets**
      - Employ TLS for WebSocket connections (WSS) to encrypt data in transit.
      - Validate messages to prevent injection attacks over WebSockets.

    - **Dependency Management**
